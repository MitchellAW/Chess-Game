# Chess-Game
A chess game built using swing in java with AI that makes very basic moves.
Mainly worked on this project as a way to focus on understanding Object Oriented concepts. My class heirarchy is kind of unneccessary, I could have definitely written it using just a Piece class with a couple extra features instead of having a class for all of the different chess pieces. However, I chose to structure it this way to improve my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism and gain some practice in applying these concepts, as they are going to be covered in my course this semester.
